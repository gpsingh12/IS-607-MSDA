Note: The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the Brady Act) mandates criminal history ,,,,,,,,
background checks on persons applying to purchase firearms from federally licensed firearm ,,,,,,,,
dealers (Federal Firearm Licensees or FFLs). The permanent provisions of the Brady Act became ,,,,,,,,
"effective on Nov. 30, 1998. The act established the National Instant Criminal Background Check ",,,,,,,,
System (NICS) and requires a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or a ,,,,,,,,
State point of contact on persons applying to receive a handgun or long gun from a FFL. NICS is a ,,,,,,,,
system comprising data on persons who are prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm ,,,,,,,,
under the Brady Act or under State law. When a background check produces evidence of factors ,,,,,,,,
"that disqualify an applicant from owning a firearm, the application is rejected. The Bureau of ",,,,,,,,
Justice Statistics began the Firearm Inquiry Statistics Program (FIST) in 1995 to collect information ,,,,,,,,
on background checks conducted by State and local agencies. These data combine FIST ,,,,,,,,
estimates of the number of checks and rejections done by State and local agencies and the FBI ,,,,,,,,
number of actual transactions and rejections reported by the NICS operations reports. Counts of ,,,,,,,,
applications received and rejected are rounded to the nearest thousand. Some data have been ,,,,,,,,
revised by the Source and will differ from previous editions.,,,,,,,,

"\b\During 2008 the FBI began a new classification system for rejections. Therefore, the data for ",,,,,,,,
2008 may not be directly comparable to previous years.,,,,,,,,
